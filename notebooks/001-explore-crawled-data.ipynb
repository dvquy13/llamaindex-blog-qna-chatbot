       "[{'title': 'Automate online tasks with MultiOn and LlamaIndex',\n",
       "  'content': 'Introduction MultiOn is an AI agents platform designed to facilitate the autonomous completion of tasks in any web environment. It empowers developers to build AI agents that can manage online activities from start to finish, handling everything from simple data retrieval to complex interactions. LlamaIndex complements this by providing an orchestration framework that bridges the gap between private and public data essential for building applications with Large Language Models. It facilitates data ingestion, indexing, and querying, making it indispensable for developers looking to leverage generative AI. In this article, we\\'ll demonstrate how MultiOn\\'s capabilities can be seamlessly integrated within the LlamaIndex framework, showcasing a practical application that leverages both technologies to automate and streamline web interactions. Technical walkthrough: Integrating MultiOn with LlamaIndex Let’s explore a practical example where MultiOn and LlamaIndex work in tandem to manage email interactions and web browsing. Step 1: Setting Up the Environment  We begin by setting up our AI agent with the necessary configurations and API keys: import  openai\\n from  llama_index.agent.openai  import  OpenAIAgent\\nopenai.api_key =  \"sk-your-key\" \\n\\n from  llama_index.tools.multion  import  MultionToolSpec\\nmultion_tool = MultionToolSpec(api_key= \"your-multion-key\" ) Step 2: Integrating Gmail Search Tool  Next, we integrate a Gmail search tool to help our agent fetch and analyze emails, providing the necessary context for further actions: from  llama_index.tools.google  import  GmailToolSpec\\n from  llama_index.core.tools.ondemand_loader_tool  import  OnDemandLoaderTool\\n\\ngmail_tool = GmailToolSpec()\\ngmail_loader_tool = OnDemandLoaderTool.from_tool(\\n    gmail_tool.to_tool_list()[ 1 ],\\n    name= \"gmail_search\" ,\\n    description= \"\"\"\\n         This tool allows you to search the users gmail inbox and give directions for how to summarize or process the emails\\n\\n        You must always provide a query to filter the emails, as well as a query_str to process the retrieved emails.\\n        All parameters are required\\n        \\n        If you need to reply to an email, ask this tool to build the reply directly\\n        Examples:\\n            query=\\'from:adam subject:dinner\\', max_results=5, query_str=\\'Where are adams favourite places to eat\\'\\n            query=\\'dentist appointment\\', max_results=1, query_str=\\'When is the next dentist appointment\\'\\n            query=\\'to:jerry\\', max_results=1, query_str=\\'summarize and then create a response email to jerrys latest email\\'\\n            query=\\'is:inbox\\', max_results=5, query_str=\\'Summarize these emails\\'\\n    \"\"\" \\n) Step 3: Initialize agent Initialise the agent with tools and a system prompt agent = OpenAIAgent.from_tools(\\n    [*multion_tool.to_tool_list(), gmail_loader_tool],\\n    system_prompt= \"\"\"\\n\\t    You are an AI agent that assists the user in crafting email responses based on previous conversations.\\n\\t    \\n\\t    The gmail_search tool connects directly to an API to search and retrieve emails, and answer questions based on the content.\\n\\t    The browse tool allows you to control a web browser with natural language to complete arbitrary actions on the web.\\n\\t    \\n\\t    Use these two tools together to gain context on past emails and respond to conversations for the user.\\n    \"\"\" \\n) Step 4: Agent Execution Flow  With our tools integrated, the agent is now equipped to perform a series of tasks: 1. Search and Summarize Emails : The agent uses LlamaIndex\\'s Gmail tool to fetch relevant emails and summarize the content, providing a basis for drafting a response. print (agent.chat( \"browse to the latest email from Julian and open the email\" )) Added user message to memory: browse to the latest email from Julian and open the email\\n=== Calling Function ===\\nCalling function: gmail_search with args: {\"query\":\"from:Julian\",\"max_results\":1,\"query_str\":\"Browse to the latest email from Julian and open the email\"}\\nPlease visit this URL to authorize this application: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id=1054044249014.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2F&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fgmail.compose+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fgmail.readonly&state=JSdsfdsi990sddsd&access_type=offline\\nGot output: Open the email from Julian to view the latest communication.\\n========================\\n \\nI have opened the latest email from Julian for you to view. If you need any specific information or action to be taken, please let me know. 2. Generate Response : Based on the summarized information, the agent crafts an appropriate response to the email chain. print (agent.chat(\\n\\t \"Summarize the email chain with julian and create a response to the last email that confirms all the details\" \\n)) Added user message to memory: Summarize the email chain with julian and create a response to the last email that confirms all the details\\n=== Calling Function ===\\nCalling function: gmail_search with args: {\"query\":\"from:Julian\",\"max_results\":1,\"query_str\":\"Summarize the email chain with Julian and create a response to the last email confirming all the details\"}\\nGot output: The email chain with Julian involved a change in an event scheduled for Friday, August 6, 2021, from 15:30 to 16:00 United Kingdom Time on Google Meet. The instructions for joining were provided in the description. The email also included contact information for joining the meeting. Julian and Nassar were listed as attendees, with Julian being the organizer. The email was authenticated and passed SPF and DKIM checks.\\n\\nIn response to the last email, I would confirm all the details of the event change, reiterating the date, time, platform (Google Meet), and any specific instructions provided. I would express gratitude for the update and confirm attendance at the revised event timing.\\n========================\\n\\nBased on the email chain with Julian, here is a summary:\\n- The event scheduled for Friday, August 6, 2021, has been changed from 15:30 to 16:00 United Kingdom Time on Google Meet.\\n- Instructions for joining the meeting were provided in the email.\\n- Attendees included Julian and Nassar, with Julian as the organizer.\\n- The email passed SPF and DKIM checks.\\n\\nTo respond and confirm all the details, you can mention the revised event date and time, the platform (Google Meet), and express gratitude for the update. Confirm your attendance at the new timing. Let me know if you would like me to draft the response email for you. 3. Send Email through MultiOn : Finally, the generated response is passed to the MultiOn agent, which manages the action of sending the email through the web browser. print (agent.chat(\\n\\t \"pass the entire generated email to the browser and have it send the email as a reply to the chain\" \\n)) Added user message to memory: pass the entire generated email to the browser and have it send the email as a reply to the chain\\n=== Calling Function ===\\nCalling function: browse with args: {\"cmd\": \"Compose a reply email to Julian confirming the event change to Fri 6 Aug 2021 from 15:30 to 16:00 UK Time on Google Meet. Express readiness to attend and thank Julian for the details.\"}\\nGot output: Email response sent to Julian\\n======================== Next Steps MultiOn is an officially supported tool on LlamaHub, the central page for all LlamaIndex integrations (from tools to LLMs to vector stores). Check out the  LlamaHub page  here. If you’re interested in running through this tutorial on building a browser + Gmail-powered agent yourself, check out our  notebook .

       "  'content': 'We’re happy to announce the recent integration of LlamaIndex with PostgresML — a comprehensive machine learning platform built on PostgreSQL. The PostgresML Managed Index allows LlamaIndex users to seamlessly manage document storage, splitting, embedding, and retrieval. By using PostgresML as the backend, users benefit from a streamlined and optimized process for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This integration unifies embedding, vector search, and text generation into a single network call, resulting in faster, more reliable, and easier-to-manage RAG workflows. The problem with typical RAG workflows Typical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows come with significant drawbacks, particularly for users. Poor performance is a major issue, as these workflows involve multiple network calls to different services for embedding, vector storage, and text generation, leading to increased latency. Additionally, there are privacy concerns when sensitive data is sent to various LLM providers. These user-centric issues are compounded by other challenges: Increased dev time to master new technologies Complicated maintenance and scalability issues due to multiple points of failure Costly vendors required for multiple services The diagram above illustrates the complexity, showing how each component interacts across different services — exacerbating these problems. Solution The PostgresML Managed Index offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges of typical RAG workflows. By managing document storage, splitting, embedding generation, and retrieval all within a single system, PostgresML significantly reduces dev time, scaling costs, and overall spend when you eliminate the need for multiple point solutions. Most importantly, it enhances the user experience by consolidating embedding, vector search, and text generation into a single network call — resulting in improved performance and reduced latency. Additionally, the use of open-source models ensures transparency and flexibility, while operating within the database addresses privacy concerns and provides users with a secure and efficient RAG workflow. About PostgresML PostgresML [ github  ||  website  ||  docs ] allows users to take advantage of the fundamental relationship between data and models, by moving the models to your database rather than constantly moving data to the models. This in-database approach to AI architecture results in more scalable, reliable and efficient applications. On the PostgresML cloud, you can perform vector operations, create embeddings, and generate real-time outputs in one process, directly where your data resides. Key highlights: Model Serving - GPU accelerated inference engine for interactive applications, with no additional networking latency or reliability costs Model Store - Access to open-source models including state of the art LLMs from Hugging Face, and track changes in performance between versions Model Training - Train models with your application data using more than 50 algorithms for regression, classification or clustering tasks; fine tune pre-trained models like Llama and BERT to improve performance Feature Store - Scalable access to model inputs, including vector, text, categorical, and numeric data: vector database, text search, knowledge graph and application data all in one low-latency system Python and JavaScript SDKs - SDK clients can perform advanced ML/AI tasks in a single SQL request without having to transfer additional data, models, hardware or dependencies to your application Serverless deployments - Enjoy instant autoscaling, so your applications can handle peak loads without overprovisioning PostgresML has a range of capabilities. In the following sections, we’ll guide you through just one use case – RAG – and how to use the PostgresML Managed Index on LlamaIndex to build a better RAG app. How it works in LlamaIndex Let’s look at a simple question-answering example using the PostgresML Managed Index. For this example, we will be using Paul Graham’s essays. Step 1: Get Your Database Connection String If you haven’t already,  create your PostgresML account . You’ll get $100 in free credits when you complete your profile. Set the PGML_DATABASE_URL environment variable: export  PGML_DATABASE_URL= \"{YOUR_CONNCECTION_STRING}\" Alternatively, you can pass the pgml_database_url argument when creating the index. Step 2: Create the PostgresML Managed Index First install Llama_index and the PostgresML Managed Index component: pip install llama_index llama-index-indices-managed-postgresml Then load in the data: mkdir  data\\ncurl -o data/paul_graham_essay.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt Finally create the PostgresML Managed Index: from  llama_index.core.readers  import  SimpleDirectoryReader\\n from  llama_index.indices.managed.postgresml  import  PostgresMLIndex\\n\\n\\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader( \"data\" ).load_data()\\nindex = PostgresMLIndex.from_documents(\\n    documents, collection_name= \"llama-index-example\" \\n) Note the collection_name is used to uniquely identify the index you are working with. Here we are using the SimpleDirectoryReader to load in the documents and then we construct the PostgresMLIndex from those documents. This workflow does not require document preprocessing. Instead, the documents are sent directly to PostgresML where they are stored, split, and embedded per the pipeline specification. For more information on pipelines see:  https://postgresml.org/docs/api/client-sdk/pipelines  Custom Pipelines can be passed into the PostgresML index at creation, but by default documents are split using the recursive_character splitter and embedded with intfloat/e5-small-v2 . Step 3: Querying Now that we have created our index we can use it for retrieval and querying: retriever = index.as_retriever()\\ndocs = retriever.retrieve( \"Was the author puzzled by the IBM 1401?\" )\\n for  doc  in  docs:\\n     print (doc) PostgreML does embedding and retrieval in a single network call. Compare this query against other common LlamaIndex embedding and vector storage configurations and you will notice a significant speed up. Using the PostgresML Index as a query_engine is just as easy: response = index.as_query_engine().query( \"Was the author puzzled by the IBM 1401?\" )\\n print (response) Once again, notice how fast the response was! The PostgresML Managed Index is doing embedding, retrieval, and augmented generation in one network call. The speed up becomes even more apparent when streaming: query_engine = index.as_query_engine(streaming= True )\\nresults = query_engine.query( \"Was the author puzzled by the IBM 1401?\" )\\n for  text  in  results.response_gen:\\n     print (text, end= \"\" , flush= True ) Note that by default the query_engine uses meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct but this is completely configurable. Key takeaways The PostgresML Managed Index uniquely unifies embedding, vector search, and text generation into a single network call. LlamaIndex users can expect faster, more reliable, and easier-to-manage RAG workflows by using PostgresML as the backend. To get started with PostgresML and LlamaIndex, you can follow the PostgresML intro  guide  to setup your account, and the examples above with your own data.',\n",

       " {'title': 'Batch inference with MyMagic AI and LlamaIndex',\n",
       "  'content': 'This is a guest post from MyMagic AI. MyMagic AI  allows processing and analyzing large datasets with AI. MyMagic AI offers a powerful API for  batch  inference (also known as  offline  or  delayed  inference) that brings various open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Llama 70B, Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B, CodeLlama70b, and advanced Embedding models to its users. Our framework is designed to perform data extraction, summarization, categorization, sentiment analysis, training data generation, and embedding, to name a few. And now it\\'s integrated directly into LlamaIndex! Part 1: batch inference How It Works: 1. Setup : Organize Your Data in an AWS S3 or GCS Bucket: Create a folder using your user ID assigned to you upon registration. Inside that folder, create another folder (called a \"session\") to store all the files you need for your tasks. Purpose of the \\'Session\\' Folder: This \"Session\" folder keeps your files separate from others, making sure that your tasks run on the right set of files. You can name your session subfolder anything you like. Granting Access to MyMagic AI: To allow MyMagic AI to securely access your files in the cloud, follow the setup instructions provided in the  MyMagic AI documentation . 2. Install : Install both MyMagic AI’s API integration and LlamaIndex library: pip install llama-index\\npip install llama-index-llms-mymagic 3. API Request:  The llamaIndex library is a wrapper around MyMagic AI’s API. What it does under the hood is simple: it sends a POST request to the MyMagic AI API while specifying the model, storage provider, bucket name, session name, and other necessary details. import  asyncio\\n from  llama_index.llms.mymagic  import  MyMagicAI\\n\\nllm = MyMagicAI(\\n    api_key= \"user_...\" ,  # provided by MyMagic AI upon sign-up \\n    storage_provider= \"s3\" ,\\n    bucket_name= \"batch-bucket\" ,  # you may name anything \\n    session= \"my-session\" ,\\n    role_arn= \"arn:aws:iam::<your account id>:role/mymagic-role\" ,\\n    system_prompt= \"You are an AI assistant that helps to summarize the documents without essential loss of information\" ,  # default prompt at https://docs.mymagic.ai/api-reference/endpoint/create \\n    region= \"eu-west-2\" ,\\n) We have designed the integration to allow the user to set up the bucket and data together with the system prompt when instantiating the llm object. Other inputs, e.g. question (i.e. your prompt), model and max_tokens are dynamic requirements when submitting complete and acomplete requests. resp = llm.complete(\\n    question= \"Summarise this in one sentence.\" ,\\n    model= \"mixtral8x7\" , \\n    max_tokens= 20 ,   # default is 10 \\n)\\n print (resp)\\n async   def   main ():\\n    aresp =  await  llm.acomplete(\\n        question= \"Summarize this in one sentence.\" ,\\n        model= \"llama7b\" ,\\n        max_tokens= 20 ,\\n    )\\n     print (aresp)\\n\\nasyncio.run(main()) This dynamic entry allows developers to experiment with different prompts and models in their workflow while also controlling for model output to cap their spending limit. MyMagic AI’s backend supports both synchronous requests (complete) and asynchronous requests (acomplete). It is advisable, however, to use our async endpoints as much as possible as batch jobs are inherently asynchronous with potentially long processing times (depending on the size of your data). Currently, we do not support chat or achat methods as our API is not designed for real-time interactive experience. However, we are planning to add those methods in the future that will function in a “batch way”. The user queries will be aggregated and appended as one prompt (to give the chat context) and sent to all files at once. Use Cases While there are myriads of use cases, here we provide a few to help motivate our users. Feel free to embed our API in your workflows that are good fit for batch processing. 1. Extraction Imagine needing to extract specific information from millions of files stored in a bucket. Information from all files will be extracted with one API call instead of a million sequential ones. 2. Classification For businesses looking to classify customer reviews such as positive, neutral, and negative. With one request you can start processing the requests over the weekend and get them ready by Monday morning. 3. Embedding Embedding text files for further machine learning applications is another powerful use case of MyMagic AI\\'s API. You will be ready for your vector db in a matter of days not weeks. 4. Training (Fine-tuning) Data Generation Imagine generating thousands of synthetic data for your fine-tuning tasks. With MyMagic AI’s API, you can reduce the generation time by a factor of 5-10x compared to GPT-3.5. 5. Transcription MyMagic AI’s API supports different types of files, so it is also easy to batch transcribe many mp3 or mp4 files in your bucket. Part 2: Integration with LlamaIndex’s RAG Pipeline The output from batch inference processes, often voluminous, can seamlessly integrate into LlamaIndex\\'s RAG pipeline for effective data storage and retrieval. This section demonstrates how to use the Llama3 model from the Ollama library coupled with BGE embedding to manage information storage and execute queries. Please ensure the following prerequisites are installed and Llama3 model is pulled: pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface\\ncurl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh\\nollama pull llama3 For this demo, we have run a batch summarization job on 5 Amazon reviews (but this might be millions in some real scenarios) and saved the results as reviews_1_5.json: {\\n  \"id_review1\": {\\n    \"query\": \"Summarize the document!\",\\n    \"output\": \"The document describes a family with a young boy who believes there is a zombie in his closet, while his parents are constantly fighting. The movie is criticized for its inconsistent genre, described as a slow-paced drama with occasional thriller elements. The review praises the well-playing parents and the decent dialogs but criticizes the lack of a boogeyman-like horror element. The overall rating is 3 out of 10.\"\\n  },\\n  \"id_review2\": {\\n    \"query\": \"Summarize the document!\",\\n    \"output\": \"The document is a positive review of a light-hearted Woody Allen comedy. The reviewer praises the witty dialogue, likable characters, and Woody Allen\\'s control over his signature style. The film is noted for making the reviewer laugh more than any recent Woody Allen comedy and praises Scarlett Johansson\\'s performance. It concludes by calling the film a great comedy to watch with friends.\"\\n  },\\n  \"id_review3\": {\\n    \"query\": \"Summarize the document!\",\\n    \"output\": \"The document describes a well-made film about one of the great masters of comedy, filmed in an old-time BBC fashion that adds realism. The actors, including Michael Sheen, are well-chosen and convincing. The production is masterful, showcasing realistic details like the fantasy of the guard and the meticulously crafted sets of Orton and Halliwell\\'s flat. Overall, it is a terrific and well-written piece.\"\\n  },\\n  \"id_review4\": {\\n    \"query\": \"Summarize the document!\",\\n    \"output\": \"Petter Mattei\\'s \\'Love in the Time of Money\\' is a visually appealing film set in New York, exploring human relations in the context of money, power, and success. The characters, played by a talented cast including Steve Buscemi and Rosario Dawson, are connected in various ways but often unaware of their shared links. The film showcases the different stages of loneliness experienced by individuals in a big city. Mattei successfully portrays the world of these characters, creating a luxurious and sophisticated look. The film is a modern adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler\\'s play on the same theme. Mattei\\'s work is appreciated, and viewers look forward to his future projects.\"\\n  },\\n  \"id_review5\": {\\n    \"query\": \"Summarize the document!\",\\n    \"output\": \"The document describes the TV show \\'Oz\\', set in the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentiary. Known for its brutality, violence, and lack of privacy, it features an experimental section of the prison called Em City, where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards. The show goes where others wouldn\\'t dare, featuring graphic violence, injustice, and the harsh realities of prison life. The viewer may become comfortable with uncomfortable viewing if they can embrace their darker side.\"\\n  },\\n  \"token_count\": 3391\\n}\\n Now let’s embed and store this document and ask questions using LlamaIndex’s query engine. Bring in our dependencies: import  os\\n\\n from  llama_index.embeddings.huggingface  import  HuggingFaceEmbedding\\n from  llama_index.core.indices.vector_store  import  VectorStoreIndex\\n from  llama_index.core.settings  import  Settings\\n from  llama_index.core.readers  import  SimpleDirectoryReader\\n from  llama_index.llms.ollama  import  Ollama Configure the embedding model and Llama3 model embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name= \"BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5\" )\\nllm = Ollama(model= \"llama3\" , request_timeout= 300.0 ) Update settings for the indexing pipeline: Settings.llm = llm\\nSettings.embed_model = embed_model\\nSettings.chunk_size =  512   # This parameter defines the size of text chunks for embedding \\n\\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader( \"reviews_1_5.json\" ).load_data()  #Modify path for your case Now create our index, our query engine and run a query: index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents, show_progress= True )\\n\\nquery_engine = index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k= 3 )\\n\\nresponse = query_engine.query( \"What is the least favourite movie?\" )\\n print (response) Output: Based on query results, the least favourite movie is: review 1 with a rating of 3 out of 10. Now we know that the review 1 is the least favorite movie among these reviews.

    "1. Distributed Service Oriented Architecture: every agent in LlamaIndex can be its own independently running microservice, orchestrated by a fully customizable LLM-powered control plane that routes and distributes tasks.\n",
    "2. Communication via standardized API interfaces: interface between agents using a central control plane orchestrator. Pass messages between agents using a message queue.\n",
    "3. Define agentic and explicit orchestration flows: developers have the flexibility to directly define the sequence of interactions between agents, or leave it up to an “agentic orchestrator” that decides which agents are relevant to the task.\n",
    "4. Ease of deployment: launch, scale and monitor each agent and your control plane independently.\n",
