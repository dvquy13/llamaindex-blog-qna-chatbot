       " 'content': \"This is a guest post from Uptrain. We are excited to announce the recent integration of LlamaIndex with UpTrain - an open-source LLM evaluation framework to evaluate your RAG pipelines and experiment with different configurations. As an increasing number of companies are graduating their LLM prototypes to production-ready systems, robust evaluations provide a systematic framework to make decisions rather than going with the ‘vibes’. By combining LlamaIndex's flexibility and UpTrain's evaluation framework, developers can experiment with different configurations, fine-tuning their LLM-based applications for optimal performance. About UpTrain UpTrain  [ github  ||  website  ||  docs ] is an open-source platform to evaluate and improve LLM applications. It provides grades for 20+ preconfigured checks (covering language, code, embedding use cases), performs root cause analyses on instances of failure cases and provides guidance for resolving them. Key Highlights: Data Security:  As an open-source solution, UpTrain conducts all evaluations and analyses locally, ensuring that your data remains within your secure environment (except for the LLM calls). Custom Evaluator LLMs:  UpTrain allows for  customisation of your evaluator LLM , offering options among several endpoints, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Llama, Mistral, or Azure. Insights that help with model improvement:  Beyond mere evaluation, UpTrain performs  root cause analysis  to pinpoint the specific components of your LLM pipeline, that are underperforming, as well as identifying common patterns among failure cases, thereby helping in their resolution. Diverse Experimentations:  The platform enables  experimentation  with different prompts, LLM models, RAG modules, embedding models, etc. and helps you find the best fit for your specific use case. Compare open-source LLMs:  With UpTrain, you can compare your fine-tuned open-source LLMs against proprietary ones (such as GPT-4), helping you to find the most cost-effective model without compromising quality. In the following sections, we will illustrate how you can use UpTrain to evaluate your LlamaIndex pipeline. The evaluations demonstrated here will help you quickly find what’s affecting the quality of your responses, allowing you to take appropriate corrective actions. LlamaIndex x UpTrain Callback Handler We introduce an UpTrain Callback Handler which makes evaluating your existing LlamaIndex Pipeline seamless. By adding just a few lines of code, UpTrain will automatically perform a series of checks - evaluating the quality of generated responses, the quality of contextual data retrieved by the RAG pipeline as well as the performance of all the interim steps. If you wish to skip right ahead to the tutorial, check it out  here. Evals across the board: From Vanilla to Advanced RAG Vanilla RAG involves a few steps. You need to embed the documents and store them in a vector database. When the user asks questions, the framework embeds them and uses similarity search to find the most relevant documents. The content of these retrieved documents, and the original query, are then passed on to the LLM to generate the final response. While the above is a great starting point, there have been a lot of improvements to achieve better results. Advanced RAG applications have many additional steps that improve the quality of the retrieved documents, which in turn improve the quality of your responses. But as Uncle Ben famously said to Peter Parker in the GenAI universe: “With increased complexity comes more points of failure.”. Most of the LLM evaluation tools only evaluate the final context-response pair and fail to take into consideration the intermediary steps of an advanced RAG pipeline. Let’s look at all the evaluations provided by UpTrain. Addressing Points of Failure in RAG Pipelines 1. RAG Query Engine Evaluation Let's first take a Vanilla RAG Pipeline and see how you can test its performance. UpTrain provides three operators curated for testing both the retrieved context as well as the LLM's response. Context Relevance : However informative the documents retrieved might be, if they are not relevant to your query, you will likely not get a response that answers your query. The Context Relevance operator determines if the documents fetched from the vector store contain information that can be used to answer your query. Factual Accuracy : Now that we have checked if the context contains information to answer our query, we will check if the response provided by the LLM is backed by the information present in the context. The Factual Accuracy operator assesses if the LLM is hallucinating or providing information that is not present in the context. Response Completeness : Not all queries are straightforward. Some of them have multiple parts to them. A good response should be able to answer all the aspects of the query. The Response Completeness operator checks if the response contains all the information requested by the query. 2. Sub-Question Query Engine Evaluation Let's say you tried out a Vanilla RAG pipeline and got consistently low Response Completeness scores. This means that the LLM is not answering all aspects of your query. One of the ways to solve this is by splitting the query into multiple smaller sub-queries that the LLM can answer more easily. To do this, you can use the SubQuestionQueryGeneration operator provided by LlamaIndex. This operator decomposes a question into sub-questions, generating responses for each using an RAG query engine. If you include this SubQuery module in your RAG pipeline, it introduces another point of failure, e.g. what if the sub-questions that we split our original question aren't good representations of it? UpTrain automatically adds new evaluations to check how well the module performs: Sub Query Completeness : It evaluates whether the sub-questions accurately and comprehensively cover the original query. Context Relevance, Factual Accuracy and Response Completeness for each of the sub-queries. 3. Reranking Evaluations We looked at a way of dealing with low Response Completeness scores. Now, let's look at a way of dealing with low Context Relevance scores. RAG pipelines retrieve documents based on semantic similarity. These documents are ordered based on how similar they are to the query asked. However, recent research [ Lost in the Middle: How Language Model Uses Long Contexts ] has shown that the LLMs are sensitive to the placement of the most critical information within the retrieved context. To solve this, you might want to add a reranking block. Reranking involves using a semantic search model (specially tuned for the reranking task) that breaks down the retrieved context into smaller chunks, finds the semantic similarity between them and the query and rewrites the context by ranking them in order of their similarity. We observed that when using the reranking operators in LlamaIndex, two scenarios can occur. These scenarios differ based on the number of nodes before and after the reranking process: a. Same Number of Nodes Before and After Reranking: If the number of nodes after the reranking remains the same, then we need to check if the new order is such that nodes higher in rank are more relevant to the query as compared to the older order. To check for this, UpTrain provides a Context Reranking operator. Context Reranking : Checks if the order of reranked nodes is more relevant to the query than the original order. b. Fewer Number of Nodes After Reranking: Reducing the number of nodes can help the LLM give better responses. This is because the LLMs process smaller context lengths better. However, we need to make sure that we don't lose information that would have been useful in answering the question. Therefore, during the process of reranking, if the number of nodes in the output is reduced, we provide a Context Conciseness operator. Context Conciseness : Examines whether the reduced number of nodes still provides all the required information. Key Takeaways: Enhancing RAG Pipelines Through Advanced Techniques and Evaluation Let's do a quick recap here. We started off with a Vanilla RAG pipeline and evaluated the quality of the generated response and retrieved context. Then, we moved to advanced RAG concepts like the SubQuery technique (used to combat cases with low Response Completeness scores) and the Reranking technique (used to improve the quality of retrieved context) and looked at advanced evaluations to quantify their performance. This essentially provides a framework to systematically test the performance of different modules as well as evaluate if they actually lead to better quality responses by making data-driven decisions. Much of the success in the field of Artificial intelligence can be attributed to experimentation with different architectures, hyperparameters, datasets, etc., and our integration with UpTrain allows you to import those best practices while building RAG pipelines.

      "LlamaParse:  Outperformed existing OCR solutions, offering superior accuracy and efficiency. Advanced Indexing and Retrieval:  Enabled flexible integration with various data sources, enhancing data management and accessibility. Rapid Prototyping and Easy Production Deployments:  LlamaCloud provides an intuitive UI for rapid prototyping and a seamless transition from UI to code for full-scale development. The Results: Accelerated Development and Enhanced Client Engagement LlamaCloud delivered remarkable improvements for  Scaleport.ai : Accelerated Development Timelines:  The team could build technical prototypes during the scoping phase, demonstrating tangible value instantly. This improved client engagement and sales outcomes. Enhanced OCR Performance:  LlamaParse outperformed GPT-4 vision on several OCR tasks, providing superior accuracy and efficiency. Flexible Data Handling:  LlamaCloud's integration with data sources and advanced indexing and retrieval capabilities allowed for quick delivery of high-quality results. Teemu Lahdenperä, CTO of Scaleport AI, shared his experience: \"LlamaCloud has really sped up our development timelines - whether it's prototyping or production deployments. Before LlamaCloud, building even a simple application took forever because we needed to write our own abstractions for everything. When building an app for a client, a LOT of the work is building the ingestion pipelines. Doing that stuff with LlamaCloud and LlamaParse is remarkably simpler. This in turn has really helped our sales outcomes since we can show tangible value instantly. We've also seen great results with LlamaParse! Specifically, we spent about 50-60% less development hours for one of our clients than we did for an equivalent application prior to LlamaCloud. The main time savings were around Llamaparse; not having to build a custom ingestion pipeline and having the indexing sorted. This helps our margins as well” Conclusion: A Game-Changer for AI Development LlamaCloud has proven to be a game-changer for  Scaleport.ai , enabling them to develop apps faster and enhance their overall AI application performance. This has accelerated their sales process! By leveraging LlamaCloud's comprehensive suite of tools,  Scaleport.ai  has positioned itself at the forefront of AI solution providers, ready to meet the evolving needs of their clients with speed, flexibility, and cutting-edge technology.

      "The Challenge: Streamlining AI Development Scaleport AI specializes in transforming emerging AI technology into tangible business results. They possess deep expertise in deploying AI across key industries such as Legal, eCommerce, Real Estate, and Finance, providing tailored generative AI solutions for production applications. Before adopting LlamaCloud and LlamaIndex, Scaleport AI faced several challenges: Long development timelines for creating technical prototypes Difficulty in demonstrating tangible value to clients during the sales process Complex setup requirements for ingestion pipelines and data processing Suboptimal OCR performance, as existing solutions were not meeting the required accuracy and efficiency standards The Solution: LlamaCloud's Comprehensive AI Development Platform Scaleport AI turned to LlamaCloud to address these challenges. LlamaCloud offered: Centralized Knowledge Interface:  Simplified data management and reduced time spent on data wrangling. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ensuring high-quality data input is crucial. \"Garbage in, garbage out\" holds especially true for LLM applications. Scalability Hurdles : Each new data source requires significant engineering hours for custom parsing and tuning. Keeping data sources in sync isn't easy either. Accuracy Concerns : Bad retrievals and hallucinations are common problems when LLMs interact with enterprise data, leading to unreliable outputs. Configuration Overload:  Fine-tuning LLM applications involves numerous parameters and often requires deep technical expertise, making iterative improvement a daunting task. As developers shift from prototypes towards building production applications - complex orchestration is needed and they want to centralize their abstractions for managing their data. They want a unified interface for processing and retrieving over their diverse sources of data. To address these difficulties, we soft-launched LlamaCloud and made LlamaParse widely available a few months ago to bring production-grade context-augmentation to your LLM and RAG applications. LlamaParse can already support 50+ languages and 100+ document formats. The adoption has been incredible - we have grown to tens of thousands of active users for LlamaParse who have processed tens of million pages! Here’s an example from Dean Barr, Applied AI Lead at Carlyle: As an AI Applied Data Scientist who was granted one of the first ML patents in the U.S., and who is building cutting-edge AI capabilities at one of the world's largest Private Equity Funds, I can confidently say that LlamaParse from LlamaIndex is currently the best technology I have seen for parsing complex document structures for Enterprise RAG pipelines. Its ability to preserve nested tables, extract challenging spatial layouts, and images is key to maintaining data integrity in advanced RAG and agentic model building. The Rise of Centralized Knowledge Management We have designed LlamaCloud to cater to the need of  production-grade   context-augmentation  for your LLM and RAG applications. Let's take a tour of what LlamaCloud brings to the table: LlamaParse : Our state-of-the-art parser that turns complex documents with tables and charts into LLM-friendly formats. You can learn more about  LlamaParse here . Managed Ingestion : Connect to enterprise data sources and your choice of data sinks with ease. We support  multiple data sources  and are adding more. LlamaCloud provides default parsing configurations for generating vector embeddings, while also allowing deep customization for specific applications. Advanced Retrieval : LlamaCloud allows basic semantic search retrieval as well as advanced techniques like hybrid search, reranking, and metadata filtering to improve the accuracy of the retrieval. This provides the necessary configurability to build end to end RAG over complex documents. LlamaCloud Playground : An interactive UI to test and refine your ingestion and retrieval strategies before deployment. Scalability and Security : Handle large volumes of production data. Compliance certifications as well as deployment options are available based on your security needs. This video gives a detailed walk through of LlamaCloud: Our customers tell us that LlamaCloud enables developers to spend less time setting up and iterating on their data pipelines for LLM use cases, allowing them to iterate through the LLM application development lifecycle much more quickly. Here’s what Teemu Lahdenpera, CTO at  Scaleport.ai  had to say: LlamaCloud has really sped up our development timelines. Getting to technical prototypes quickly allows us to show tangible value instantly, improving our sales outcomes. When needed, switching from the LlamaCloud UI to code has been really seamless. The configurable parsing and retrieval features have significantly improved our response accuracy. We've also seen great results with LlamaParse and found it outperforming GPT-4 vision on some OCR tasks! Try it yourself We’ve opened up an official waitlist for LlamaCloud.

      "The latest updates to LlamaCloud\n",
      "To build a production-quality LLM agent over your data, you need a production-quality data processing layer. LlamaCloud is that data processing and management layer for your AI knowledge assistants. Since  launching a LlamaCloud waitlist last week , we’ve gotten hundreds of signups and published case studies showing how it cuts  production development hours by 50% . On top of that, our team has shipped a slew of new features at a breakneck pace in the past week. We’re excited to highlight these new features that collectively help you  set up a chat interface in minutes,   increase developer collaboration within your team, and access more data and metadata. Set up a Chat Interface in Minutes We are releasing  LlamaCloud Chat,  which gives you an easy-to-use chat interface over your data. This chat interface is a conversational RAG pipeline built over the advanced retrieval interface that a given pipeline provides, and has out-of-the-box support for streaming and citations - it’s powered by the same DNA as  create-llama , our fully open-source set up tool  for LLM applications. The LlamaCloud UI already lets you set up a data pipeline over any data in minutes, and now you get a full-blown ChatGPT over your data in minutes. Besides the chat UI, you also have additional flexibility: You can customize metadata filters in the retrieval parameters You can view retrieved nodes and their source files Besides chunk-level retrieval, you can now do  file-level retrieval  (more on this soon!) LlamaCloud is fundamentally a developer tool: with these updates, we enable developers to spend less time on data pipeline setup and iteration, and more time on writing the orchestration logic on top of this interface. Increased Developer Collaboration The team selection interface Organization settings We’ve added  organizational features  into LlamaCloud, enabling any individual user to create an organization and add other users to the organization. Any user within an organization will have a view of all the organization’s projects and indexes within each project. This allows your team to have a single-source of truth for your data pipelines. In the past each developer would spend time re-indexing/experimenting with the same sources of data. This feature enables transparency, re-use, and generally more rapid development velocity. Improved Data and Metadata Access We’ve made several updates here - we’ve added more data connectors and added features to let you more easily access and customize metadata. We added a Notion, Slack, and Jira Connector Our Sharepoint connector now natively integrates with user IDs that you can filter for, enabling you to build LLM applications with access control. You can now attach metadata to any uploaded file as a CSV - do this through the UI or our API! Want to see what LlamaCloud can do for you? \n",

      "Ensuring high-quality data input is crucial. \"Garbage in, garbage out\" holds especially true for LLM applications. Scalability Hurdles : Each new data source requires significant engineering hours for custom parsing and tuning. Keeping data sources in sync isn't easy either. Accuracy Concerns : Bad retrievals and hallucinations are common problems when LLMs interact with enterprise data, leading to unreliable outputs. Configuration Overload:  Fine-tuning LLM applications involves numerous parameters and often requires deep technical expertise, making iterative improvement a daunting task. As developers shift from prototypes towards building production applications - complex orchestration is needed and they want to centralize their abstractions for managing their data. They want a unified interface for processing and retrieving over their diverse sources of data. To address these difficulties, we soft-launched LlamaCloud and made LlamaParse widely available a few months ago to bring production-grade context-augmentation to your LLM and RAG applications. LlamaParse can already support 50+ languages and 100+ document formats. The adoption has been incredible - we have grown to tens of thousands of active users for LlamaParse who have processed tens of million pages! Here’s an example from Dean Barr, Applied AI Lead at Carlyle: As an AI Applied Data Scientist who was granted one of the first ML patents in the U.S., and who is building cutting-edge AI capabilities at one of the world's largest Private Equity Funds, I can confidently say that LlamaParse from LlamaIndex is currently the best technology I have seen for parsing complex document structures for Enterprise RAG pipelines. Its ability to preserve nested tables, extract challenging spatial layouts, and images is key to maintaining data integrity in advanced RAG and agentic model building.

      "This is in line with the information provided in the abstract of the context. The response also correctly states the range of parameters for the large language models developed as being from 7 billion to 70 billion, which is also confirmed in the context. Therefore, the response is in line with the context information provided. [RESULT] YES GPT-4 Relevancy Score:  1.0 Observation: Prometheus: If you compare the feedback and contexts, there is mention of a range of parameters in the context and response but the feedback says the model could not find such information. GPT-4: Evaluates it correctly, unlike the Prometheus model. Summary The cost for evaluation (approx.):  $1.5  for Prometheus Model and  $15  for GPT4. The Prometheus model, though offering more detailed feedback than GPT-4, occasionally provides incorrect feedback, necessitating cautious application. If a generated answer lacks certain facts present in the reference answer, the Prometheus model applies stricter penalties to scores than GPT-4. The faithfulness and relevancy feedback of Prometheus shows more hallucinations/ wrong interpretations in the feedback compared to GPT-4.

      "This is related to the above statement. A lot of summarization strategies over big documents involve “hacks” such as sequential refinement or hierarchical summarization (see our  response synthesis modules  as a reference guide). This can now be alleviated with a single LLM call. Personalized memory will be better and easier to build:  A key issue for building conversational assistants is figuring out how to load sufficient conversational context into the prompt window. 4k tokens easily overflows this window for very basic web search agents - if it decides to load in a Wikipedia page for instance, that text will easily overflow the context. 1M-10M context windows will let developers more easily implement conversational memory with fewer compression hacks (e.g. vector search or automatic KG construction). There are, however, some lingering challenges: 10M tokens is not enough for large document corpuses - kilodoc retrieval is still a challenge.  1M tokens is around ~7 Uber SEC 10K filings. 10M tokens would be around ~70 filings. 10M tokens is roughly bounded by 40MB of data. While this is enough for many “small” document corpuses, many knowledge corpuses in the enterprise are in the gigabytes or terabytes. To build LLM-powered systems over these knowledge corpuses, developers will still need to build in some way of retrieving this data to augment language models with context. Embedding models are lagging behind in context length.  So far the largest context window we’ve seen for embeddings are  32k from together.ai . This means that even if the chunks used for synthesis with long-context LLMs can be big, any text chunks used for retrieval still need to be a lot smaller. Cost and Latency.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluation Metrics: The research team used a wide range of metrics suited to each dataset. The geometric mean of ROUGE scores for QM, the exact matching (EM) score for QLTY, and F1 scores for others were the primary metrics. Results Baseline models without retrieval, having a 4K sequence length, performed poorly since valuable texts get truncated. With retrieval, performance for 4K models like LLaMA2–70B-4K and GPT-43B-4K significantly improved. HotpotQA, a multi-hop dataset, particularly benefits from longer sequence models. Models with longer contexts (16K, 32K) outperform their 4K counterparts even when fed the same evidence chunks. There exists a unique “U-shaped” performance curve for LLMs due to the  lost in the middle  phenomenon, making them better at utilizing information at the beginning or end of the input. The study presents a contrasting perspective to LongBench’s findings, emphasizing that retrieval is beneficial for models regardless of their context window size. Comparing to OpenAI Models: The LLaMA2–70B-32k model with retrieval surpasses the performance of GPT-3.5-turbo variants and is competitive with Davinci-003, underscoring its robustness in handling long context tasks. Comparison of Different Retrievers: Retrieval consistently enhances the performance across different retrievers. Public retrievers outperformed proprietary ones like OpenAI embeddings. Comparing with the number of retrieved chunks: The best performance is achieved by retrieving the top 5 or 10 chunks. Retrieving more, up to 20 chunks, doesn’t offer additional benefits and can even degrade performance. The deterioration in performance when adding more chunks could be due to the  lost-in-the-middle  phenomenon or the model being sidetracked by non-relevant information. Conclusion As we delved deep into understanding how retrieval augmentation and long-context extension interact when applied to leading language models fine-tuned for long-context question-answering and summarization tasks. Here are some things to be noted: Boost in Performance with Retrieval : Implementing retrieval techniques significantly enhances the performance of both shorter 4K context language models and their longer 16K/32K context counterparts. Efficiency of 4K Models with Retrieval : 4K context language models, when combined with retrieval augmentation, can achieve performance levels similar to 16K long context models. Plus, they have the added advantage of being faster during the inference process. Best Model Performance : After enhancing with both context window extension and retrieval augmentation, the standout model, LLaMA2–70B-32k-ret (LLaMA2–70B-32k with retrieval), surpasses well-known models like GPT-3.5-turbo-16k and davinci-003.

      "However, such re-ranking models generally have context window limitations. To address the above issues, we propose a Question-aware Coarse-Grained prompt compression method. This method evaluates the relevance between the context and the question based on the perplexity corresponding to the question. To mitigate the hallucination problem in smaller LLMs, we append a restrictive statement, specifically “ We can get the answer to this question in the given documents ”, after the question to limit the latent space caused by related hallucinations.

      "NVIDIA Research: RAG with Long Context LLMs\n",
      "Introduction Why Long Context Matters and How Retrieval Augmentation Steps In: In the dynamic landscape of LLMs, two methods have gained traction and seem to be taking center stage: expanding the context window of Large Language Models (LLMs) and enhancing these models with retrieval capabilities. The continued evolution of GPU technology, coupled with breakthroughs in attention mechanisms, has given rise to long-context LLMs. Simultaneously, the concept of retrieval — where LLMs pick up only the most relevant context from a standalone retriever — promises a revolution in efficiency and speed. In the midst of these evolving narratives, some interesting questions emerge: Retrieval-augmentation versus long context window, which one is better for downstream tasks? Can both methods be combined to get the best of both worlds? To dissect these questions, in this blog post we turn to  NVIDIA’s recent study , which harnesses the power of two powerful LLMs: the proprietary GPT — 43B and LLaMA2–70B, the research strives to provide actionable insights for AI practitioners. Prior Research and the NVIDIA Divergence: Interestingly, while NVIDIA’s findings are interesting in many respects, Another recent work by  Bai et al. (2023)  also ventured into similar territory, although with differing outcomes. Their work explored the impact of retrieval on long context LLMs, evaluating models like GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k and Llama2–7B-chat-4k. However, their findings diverge from NVIDIA’s in crucial ways.  Bai et al.  discerned that retrieval was beneficial only for the Llama2–7B-chat-4k with a 4K context window, but not for extended context models like GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k. One hypothesis for this difference centers on the challenges tied to experiments using black-box APIs and the smaller white-box LLMs they employed, which potentially had limited capability to integrate context through retrieval. NVIDIA’s work distinguishes itself by tapping into much larger LLMs, yielding results that not only match top-tier models like ChatGPT-3.5 but even indicate further enhancements when incorporating retrieval methods. Models, Datasets, and Evaluation Metrics Large Language Models (LLMs) Explored: The researchers delved deep into the potential of large language models for tasks like generative QA and summarization. Specifically, two models were the primary focus: Nemo GPT-43B:  A proprietary 43 billion parameter model trained on 1.1T tokens, 70% of which were in English. This model was fed a rich diet of web archives, Wikipedia, Reddit, books, and more. It contains 48 layers and is trained using RoPE embeddings. LLaMA2–70B:  A publicly available 70B parameter model trained on 2T tokens, primarily in English. It’s structured with 80 layers and also utilizes RoPE embeddings. Context Window Extension: To enhance the models’ capability to process longer contexts, their initial 4K context window length was augmented. The GPT-43B was modified to handle 16K, while the LLaMA2–70B was expanded to both 16K and 32K, employing the position interpolation method. Instruction Tuning: To optimize the LLMs for the tasks at hand, instruction tuning was implemented. A diverse dataset blend, comprising sources like Soda, ELI5, FLAN, and others, was created. \n",

This guide offers a structured approach for improving retrieval systems through the fine-tuning of the Cohere re-ranker. Summary: In this blog post, we’ve demonstrated fine-tuning a Cohere reranker (custom reranker) using LlamaIndex, which has improved retrieval performance metrics.

Using Multi-Modal LLMs For Generator Evaluations (LMM-As-A-Judge) Multi-modal models (i.e., LMMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4V or open-source alternatives like LLaVA are able to take in both input and image context to produce an answer the user query. As in text-only RAG, we are also concerned about the “relevancy” and “faithfulness” of these generated answers. But in order to be able to compute such metrics in the multi-modal case, we would need a judge model that is also able to take in the context images and text data. Thus, in the multi-modal case, we adopt the LMM-As-A-Judge pattern in order to compute relevancy and faithfulness as well as other related metrics! Relevancy (multi-modal): considers  textual and visual context  and evaluates how much the generated response matches the query. Faithfulness (multi-modal): evaluates how much the generated response matches the retrieved  textual and visual context . If you want to test these out, then you’re in luck as we’ve recently released our beta Multi-Modal Evaluator abstractions! See the code snippet below for how one can use these abstractions to perform their respective evaluations on a generated response to a given query. from  llama_index.evaluation.multi_modal  import  (\n",

      " The prompt format implies that the text for each document should be relatively concise. There are two ways of feeding in the text to the prompt corresponding to each document: You can directly feed in the raw text corresponding to the document. This works well if the document corresponds to a bite-sized text chunk. You can feed in a condensed summary for each document. This would be preferred if the document itself corresponds to a long-piece of text. We do this under the hood with our new  document summary index , but you can also choose to do it yourself. Given a collection of documents, we can then create document “batches” and send each batch into the LLM input prompt. The output of each batch would be the set of relevant documents + relevance scores within that batch. The final retrieval response would aggregate relevant documents from all batches. You can use our abstractions in two forms: as a standalone retriever module ( ListIndexLLMRetriever ) or a reranker module ( LLMRerank ). The remainder of this blog primarily focuses on the reranker module given the speed/cost. LLM Retriever (ListIndexLLMRetriever) This module is defined over a list index, which simply stores a set of nodes as a flat list. You can build the list index over a set of documents and then use the LLM retriever to retrieve the relevant documents from the index. from  llama_index  import  GPTListIndex\n",

LLM Reranker (LLMRerank) This module is defined as part of our  NodePostprocessor  abstraction, which is defined for second-stage processing after an initial retrieval pass. The postprocessor can be used on its own or as part of a  RetrieverQueryEngine  call.

      "retrieved_nodes = reranker.postprocess_nodes(retrieved_nodes, query_bundle) Limitations/Caveats There are certain limitations and caveats to LLM-based retrieval, especially with this initial version. LLM-based retrieval is orders of magnitude slower than embedding-based retrieval. Embedding search over thousands or even millions of embeddings can take less than a second. Each LLM prompt of 4000 tokens to OpenAI can take minutes to complete. Using third-party LLM API’s costs money. The current method of batching documents may not be optimal, because it relies on an assumption that document batches can be scored independently of each other. This lacks a global view of the ranking for all documents. Using the LLM to retrieve and rank every node in the document corpus can be prohibitively expensive. This is why using the LLM as a second-stage reranking step, after a first-stage embedding pass, can be helpful. Initial Experimental Results Let’s take a look at how well LLM reranking works! We show some comparisons between naive top-k embedding-based retrieval as well as the two-stage retrieval pipeline with a first-stage embedding-retrieval filter and second-stage LLM reranking. We also showcase some results of pure LLM-based retrieval (though we don’t showcase as many results given that it tends to run a lot slower than either of the first two approaches). We analyze results over two very different sources of data: the Great Gatsby and the 2021 Lyft SEC 10-k. We only analyze results over the “retrieval” portion and not synthesis to better isolate the performance of different retrieval methods. The results are presented in a qualitative fashion. \n",

      "Keyword Queries GTR retriever recall rate 5. Queries With Misspellings What is the advntage of prposition retrieval over sentnce or passage retrieval? 6. Exact Sub-string Searches first kwords for the GTR retriever. Finer-grained Retrieval Evaluation Metrics: We will utilize Hit Rate and MRR metrics for retrieval evaluation. Let’s get into understanding these metrics. Hit Rate: Hit Rate measures the proportion of queries for which the correct chunk/ context appears within the top-k results chunks/ contexts. Put simply, it evaluates how frequently our system correctly identifies the chunk within its top-k chunks. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR): MRR assesses a system’s accuracy by taking into account the position of the highest-ranking relevant chunk/ context for each query. It calculates the average of the inverse of these positions across all queries. For instance, if the first relevant chunk/ context is at the top of the list, its reciprocal rank is 1. If it’s the second item, the reciprocal rank becomes 1/2, and this pattern continues accordingly.

      "A Cheat Sheet and Some Recipes For Building Advanced RAG\n",
      "It’s the start of a new year and perhaps you’re looking to break into the RAG scene by building your very first RAG system. Or, maybe you’ve built Basic RAG systems and are now looking to enhance them to something more advanced in order to better handle your user’s queries and data structures. In either case, knowing where or how to begin may be a challenge in and of itself! If that’s true, then hopefully this blog post points you in the right direction for your next steps, and moreover, provides for you a mental model for you to anchor your decisions when building advanced RAG systems. The RAG cheat sheet shared above was greatly inspired by a recent RAG survey paper ( “Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey” Gao, Yunfan, et al. 2023 ). Basic RAG Mainstream RAG as defined today involves retrieving documents from an external knowledge database and passing these along with the user’s query to an LLM for response generation. In other words, RAG involves a Retrieval component, an External Knowledge database and a Generation component.

      "response = query_engine.query( \"A user's query\" ) Success Requirements for RAG In order for a RAG system to be deemed as a success (in the sense of providing useful and relevant answers to user questions), there are really only two high level requirements: Retrieval must be able to find the most relevant documents to a user query. Generation must be able to make good use of the retrieved documents to sufficiently answer the user query. Advanced RAG With the success requirements defined, we can then say that building advanced RAG is really about the application of more sophisticated techniques and strategies (to the Retrieval or Generation components) to ensure that they are ultimately met. Furthermore, we can categorize a sophisticated technique as either one that addresses one of the two high-level success requirements independent (more or less) of the other, or one that addresses both of these requirements simultaneously. Advanced techniques for Retrieval must be able to find the most relevant documents to a user query Below we briefly describe a couple of the more sophisticated techniques to help achieve the first success requirement. Chunk-Size Optimization:  Since LLMs are restricted by context length, it is necessary to chunk documents when building the External Knowledge database. Chunks that are too big or too small can pose problems for the Generation component leading to in accurate responses.

      "Building Scalable RAG Applications with LlamaIndex and Zilliz Cloud Pipelines\n",
      "Introduction We are seeing a huge wave of developers building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. The RAG tech stack generally contains a retrieval pipeline, LLM and prompt, among which LLM is accessible and developers are comfortable with prompt customization. However, developers new to search and index often need extensive help to build an effective  retrieval  pipeline. A production-ready retrieval pipeline typically consists of the following components: Document loader that parses and splits the long text Embedding model serving as core indexing component A vector database that stores the vector embeddings Advanced components to future optimize retrieval quality, such as re-ranker model to judge semantic similarity better It’s challenging to operate this complex tech stack. It involves managing software package dependencies, hosting services in Kubernetes clusters, and monitoring the performance of ML models. The high DevOps cost distracts developers from the most critical part of the user experience of RAG applications: prompt engineering, answer generation, and user interface. While experienced search infrastructure engineers may still manage a complicated tech stack for its flexibility, Zilliz believes that most RAG developers could benefit from a retrieval API service that is user-friendly and allows for lighter customization. Integrating  Zilliz Cloud Pipelines  and  LlamaIndex  brings a new approach to solving this problem. Zilliz Cloud Pipelines is a fully managed, scalable retrieval service. LlamaIndex is a flexible RAG framework that provides libraries and tools for organizing business logics such as retrieval and prompt engineering. The API service of Zilliz Cloud Pipelines is abstracted as a ManagedIndex in LlamaIndex. RAG developers using  ZillizCloudPipelineIndex  can easily scale the app from one user to millions of users without the hassle of setting up and maintaining the complex retrieval tech stack. It hides the technical complexity behind a few function calls, so that developers can focus on the core user experience of their RAG apps. In this blog, we show how to use  ZillizCloudPipelineIndex  to build a high quality RAG chatbot. The chatbot is scalable and supports multi-tenancy through metadata filtering. Set up Since Zilliz Cloud Pipelines is an API service, first you need to set up a  Zilliz Cloud  account and create a free serverless cluster. Now you can construct  ZillizCloudPipelineIndex  and get the handler to index docs and query later. from llama_index.indices import ZillizCloudPipelineIndex\n",

The llama-index library consists of several evaluation abstractions as well as integrations to RAGAs in order to help builders gain an understanding of the level to which their RAG system achieves the success requirements through the lens of these measurement aspects. Below, we list a select few of the evaluation notebook guides.

      "\n",
      "What retrieval strategy to use? LlamaIndex makes it easy to try many of them without having to deal with the complexity of integrations, prompts and memory all at once. Initially, we at Langfuse worked on complex RAG/agent applications and quickly realized that there is a new need for observability and experimentation to tweak and iterate on the details. In the end, these details matter to get from something cool to an actually reliable RAG application that is safe for users and customers. Think of this: if there is a user session of interest in your  production  RAG application, how can you quickly see whether the retrieved context for that session was actually relevant or the LLM response was on point? Thus, we started working on  Langfuse.com  ( GitHub ) to establish an open source LLM engineering platform with tightly integrated features for tracing, prompt management, and evaluation. In the beginning we just solved our own and our friends’ problems. Today we are at over 1000 projects which rely on Langfuse, and 2.3k stars on GitHub. You can either  self-host  Langfuse or use the  cloud instance  maintained by us. We are thrilled to announce our new integration with LlamaIndex today. This feature was  highly requested  by our community and aligns with our project's focus on native integration with major application frameworks. Thank you to everyone who contributed and tested it during the beta phase! The challenge We love LlamaIndex, since the clean and standardized interface abstracts a lot of complexity away. Let’s take this simple example of a VectorStoreIndex and a ChatEngine. from  llama_index.core  import  SimpleDirectoryReader\n",
      " from  llama_index.core  import  VectorStoreIndex\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "chat_engine = index.as_chat_engine()\n",
      "\n",
      " print (chat_engine.chat( \"What problems can I solve with RAG?\" ))\n",
      " print (chat_engine.chat( \"How do I optimize my RAG application?\" )) In just 3 lines we loaded our local documents, added them to an index and initialized a ChatEngine with memory. Subsequently we had a stateful conversation with the chat_engine. This is awesome to get started, but we quickly run into questions like: “What context is actually retrieved from the index to answer the questions?” “How is chat memory managed?” “Which steps add the most latency to the overall execution? How to optimize it?” One-click OSS observability to the rescue We integrated Langfuse to be a one-click integration with LlamaIndex using the global callback manager. Preparation Install the community package (pip install llama-index-callbacks-langfuse) Copy/paste the environment variables from the Langfuse project settings to your Python project: 'LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY', 'LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY' and 'LANGFUSE_HOST' Now, you only need to set the global langfuse handler: from  llama_index.core  import  set_global_handler\n",
      "\n",
      "set_global_handler( \"langfuse\" ) And voilá, with just two lines of code you get detailed traces for all aspects of your RAG application in Langfuse. They automatically include latency and usage/cost breakdowns. Group multiple chat threads into a session Working with lots of teams building GenAI/LLM/RAG applications, we’ve continuously added more features that are useful to debug and improve these applications. One example is  session tracking  for conversational applications to see the traces in context of a full message thread. To activate it, just add an id that identifies the session as a trace param before calling the chat_engine. from  llama_index.core  import  global_handler\n",

      "chat_engine.chat( \"How old is he?\" ) Thereby you can see all these chat invocations grouped into a session view in Langfuse Tracing: Next to sessions, you can also track individual users or add tags and metadata to your Langfuse traces. Trace more complex applications and use other Langfuse features for prompt management and evaluation This integration makes it easy to get started with Tracing. If your application ends up growing into using custom logic or other frameworks/packages, all Langfuse integrations are fully interoperable. We have also built additional features to version control and collaborate on prompts (langfuse  prompt management ), track  experiments , and  evaluate  production traces. For RAG specifically, we collaborated with the RAGAS team and it’s easy to run their popular eval suite on traces captured with Langfuse (see  cookbook ).

We hope you’ll find it useful in enhancing the effectiveness of your RAG systems, and we’re thrilled to share it with you. The OpenAI Cookbook has three sections: Understanding Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):  provides a detailed overview of RAG systems, including the various stages involved in building the RAG system. Building RAG with LlamaIndex:  Here, we dive into the practical aspects, demonstrating how to construct a RAG system using LlamaIndex, specifically applied to Paul Graham’s essay, utilizing the  VectorStoreIndex . Evaluating RAG with LlamaIndex:  The final section focuses on assessing the RAG system’s performance in two critical areas:  the Retrieval System  and  Response Generation. We use our unique synthetic dataset generation method,  generate_question_context_pairs  to conduct thorough evaluations in these areas. Our goal with this  cookbook  is to provide the community with an essential resource for effectively evaluating and enhancing RAG systems developed using LlamaIndex. \n",

      "Introducing the new  llamaindex-cli  tool, installed when you  pip install llama-index  ! It uses  Chroma  under the hood, so you’ll need to  pip install chromadb  as well. How to use it Set the  OPENAI_API_KEY  environment variable:  By default, this tool uses OpenAI’s API. As such, you’ll need to ensure the OpenAI API Key is set under the  OPENAI_API_KEY  environment variable whenever you use the tool. $ export OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;api_key&gt; 2. Ingest some files:  Now, you need to point the tool at some local files that it can ingest into the local vector database. For this example, we’ll ingest the LlamaIndex  README.md  file: $ llamaindex-cli rag --files \"./README.md\" You can only specify a file glob pattern such as $ llamaindex-cli rag --files \"./docs/**/*.rst\" 3. Ask a Question : You can now start asking questions about any of the documents you’d ingested in the prior step: $ llamaindex-cli rag --question  \"What is LlamaIndex?\"  \n",
      "LlamaIndex is a data framework that helps in ingesting, structuring, and accessing  private  or domain-specific data  for  LLM-based applications. It provides tools such as data connectors to ingest data from various sources, data indexes to structure the data, and engines  for  natural language access to the data. LlamaIndex follows a Retrieval-Augmented  Generation   (RAG)  approach, where it retrieves information from data sources, adds it to the question as context, and then asks the LLM to generate an answer based on the enriched prompt. This approach overcomes the limitations of fine-tuning LLMs and provides a more cost-effective, up-to-date, and trustworthy solution  for  data augmentation. LlamaIndex is designed  for  both beginner and advanced users, with a high-level API  for  easy usage and lower-level APIs  for  customization and extension. 4. Open a Chat REPL : You can even open a chat interface within your terminal! Just run  llamaindex-cli rag --chat  and start asking questions about the files you’ve ingested. Customize it to your heart’s content! You can customize  llamaindex-cli  to use any LLM model, even local models like Mixtral 8x7b through  Ollama , and you can build more advanced query and retrieval techniques.  Check the documentation  for details on how to get started.\n",

NewsGPT by Kang-Chi Ho:  https://buff.ly/46jkutx FinSight by Vishwas Gowda:  https://buff.ly/3PzOnyC ✨  Feature Releases   and Enhancements: Multi-Document Agents : we introduced multi-document agents (V0) for advanced QA, beyond typical top-k RAG. They support diverse queries from single to multiple docs. This foundational version sets the stage for future enhancements like parallel query planning and reduced latency.  Docs ,  Tweet . Ensemble Retriever:  we’re addressing the RAG challenge of determining chunk size by experimenting with diverse document chunking and ensembling for retrieval.  Docs ,  Tweet . HuggingFace Embeddings : we added native support for three more Hugging Face embedding models, including the base embeddings wrapper, instructor embeddings, and optimum embeddings in ONNX format.  Docs ,  Tweet . OpenAI Function Calling fine-tuning:  we’re using OpenAI’s latest function calling fine-tuning which enhanced structured data extraction, optimizing gpt-3.5-turbo for improved extraction in RAG.  Docs ,  Tweet . Metadata Extraction : we’re making metadata extraction efficient by extracting a complete Pydantic object from a document with just one LLM call.  Docs ,  Tweet . Structured RAG Outputs : we now efficiently structure RAG pipeline outputs with native Pydantic outputs from all queries without the need for an additional LLM parsing call.  Docs ,  Tweet . Streamlined  secinsights.ai  deployment : Our open-sourced  secinsights.ai  offers a RAG app template, now enhanced with GitHub Codespaces and Docker for swift cloud deployment without setup hassles.  Tweet . LongContextReorder:  We introduced LongContextReorder****,**** Zeneto’s approach to reposition vital context in RAG systems, addressing the challenge of over-retrieving which can obscure essential details.

      "Download a llamafile 2. Make the llamafile executable We'll go through each step in detail below. Step 1: Download a llamafile There are many llamafiles available on the  HuggingFace model hub  (just search for 'llamafile') but for the purpose of this walkthrough, we'll use  TinyLlama-1.1B  (0.67 GB,  model info ). To download the model, you can either click this download link:  TinyLlama-1.1B  or open a terminal and use something like `wget`. The download should take 5-10 minutes depending on the quality of your internet connection. wget https://huggingface.co/Mozilla/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-llamafile/resolve/main/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.F16.llamafile  This model is small and won't be very good at actually answering questions but, since it's a relatively quick download and its inference speed will allow you to index your vector store in just a few minutes, it's good enough for the examples below. For a higher-quality LLM, you may want to use a larger model like  Mistral-7B-Instruct  (5.15 GB,  model info ). Step 2: Make the llamafile executable If you didn't download the llamafile from the command line, figure out where your browser stored your downloaded llamafile. Now, open your computer's terminal and, if necessary, go to the directory where your llamafile is stored: `cd path/to/downloaded/llamafile` If you're using macOS, Linux, or BSD , you'll need to grant permission for your computer to execute this new file. (You only need to do this once.): If you're on Windows, instead just rename the file by adding \".exe\" on the end  e.g. rename `TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile` to `TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile.exe` chmod +x TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile Kick the tires Now, your llamafile should be ready to go. First, you can check which version of the llamafile library was used to build the llamafile binary you should downloaded: ./TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile --version\n",
      "\n",
      "llamafile v0.7.0 This post was written using a model built with `llamafile v0.7.0`. If your llamafile displays a different version and some of the steps below don't work as expected, please  post an issue on the llamafile issue tracker . The easiest way to use your llamafile is via its built-in chat interface. In a terminal, run ./TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile Your browser should open automatically and display a chat interface. (If it doesn't, just open your browser and point it at http://localhost:8080). When you're done chatting, return to your terminal and hit `Control-C` to shut down llamafile. If you're running these commands inside a notebook, just interrupt the notebook kernel to stop the llamafile. In the rest of this walkthrough, we'll be using the llamafile's built-in inference server instead of the browser interface. The llamafile's server provides a REST API for interacting with the TinyLlama LLM via HTTP. Full server API documentation is available  here . To start the llamafile in server mode, run: ./TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.Q5_K_M.llamafile --server --nobrowser --embedding Summary: Download and run a llamafile # 1.

      "Context:\n",
      "Image input to LLM. The LLM got two identical images as input, which just shows that I reuse some of my diagrams. However, I am pleasantly surprised by CLIP embeddings as they were able to retrieve he most relevant image out of the collection. In a more production setting, you might want to clean and deduplicate images, but that is beyond the scope of this article. Conclusion LLMs are evolving faster than what we are historically used to and are spanning across multiple modalities. I firmly believe that by the end of the next year, LLMs will be soon able to comprehend videos, and be therefore able to pick up non-verbal cues while talking to you. On the other hand, we can use images as input to RAG pipeline and enhance the variety of information passed to an LLM, making responses better and more accurate. The multimodal RAG pipelines implementation with LlamaIndex and Neo4j is as easy as it gets. The code is available on  GitHub .\n",

      "Fine-Tuning Embeddings for RAG with Synthetic Data\n",
      "UPDATE 9/10/2023:  We’ve included embedding finetuning abstractions into the LlamaIndex repo, so this repo is technically outdated! Please check out our  embedding fine-tuning guides  in the core documentation. We’ve created a  comprehensive, end-to-end guide  showing you how to fine-tune an embedding model to improve performance of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems over any unstructured text corpus (no labels required!). The result is a  5–10% performance increase in retrieval evaluation metrics  — our finetuned  bge  model almost reaches  text-embedding-ada-002  levels of retrieval performance in terms of hit rate. This enables more accurate retrieval which leads to better RAG systems as a whole. This tutorial is helpful to  anyone  building RAG systems: If you’re new to finetuning, no problem! We have  step by step notebooks  walking through the key steps. Simply substitute the file links for your own data, and just run every cell. Finetuning embedding models is lightweight and doesn’t require a GPU. These notebooks were tested on an M2 Macbook Pro. Resources Repo:  https://github.com/run-llama/finetune-embedding Notebooks:  Dataset Generation ,  Finetuning ,  Evaluation Background/Context The Current RAG Stack RAG is a popular paradigm for connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) with an external source of data that was not present in its training corpus. It pairs a  retrieval model  over a knowledge bank with the LLM through its input prompt space. RAG stacks typically look like the following: Indexing : Prepare a corpus of unstructured text, parse/chunk it. Then  embed  each chunk and put in a vector database. Query-time:  Retrieve  context from the vector db using top-k embedding similarity lookup, and stuff context into the LLM input space. (Of course RAG can be much more advanced than this, and LlamaIndex provides tools for both  simple and advanced RAG ) Unfortunately RAG is easy to prototype by cobbling together the different components, but hard to productionize. The simple stack has many failure modes and oftentimes the issue lies with bad retrieval — if the returned context is irrelevant to the query, then the capability of the LLM is irrelevant; the answer will always be bad. How Can We Make Retrieval Better? \n",
